## About me

Hey, I'm Tachanks, an aspiring mechanical engineer, however I code as a hobby. I've worked on various side projects, mostly starting out with front end and soon-to-be backend web development. I'm currently a student working on these projects in my free time alongside various clubs and organizations I'm with.

My website is https://tachanks.xyz where you can see my projects along other random stuff I felt like adding. My skills have gotten much better than shown on my site I just have not had the time to change it otherwise.
